# HelloWorld

# HackAThing submission

For my HackAThing, I followed the React Native iOS tutorial found at this link: 
  https://www.toptal.com/ios/cold-dive-into-react-native-a-beginners-tutorial

This project creates a simple iOS app that consists of a single button. 
When pressed, the button will then show an alert with the text "Hi!". 
The alert can be dismissed by clicking "OK".

I attempted many different tutorials, and ran into trouble with a few of them. 
I found that most were out of date and difficult to update to React's most 
recent version. As a result, I decided to complete a much simpler tutorial that
would allow me to gain a better understanding of styles, rendering, and event handling
with React Native. 

The only problem with this submission occurs within the Headline variable. It seems
as though my code does not register props.caption correctly––despite following the
tutorial closely. Rather than "Hello . Please click me.", my text box should say:
"Hello Component. Please Click me." This discrepancy comes from props.caption. 

Overall, I am glad I attempted multiple tutorials (links below) and tried to 
troubleshoot my code. I am excited to do more complex things with React Native
throughout the course of CS98!
